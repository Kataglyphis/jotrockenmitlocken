# driver had hand-rolled the same guard-then-exec block; getting it wrong is
# silent, because `exec` on a missing file under `set -e` reports only bash's

#
# WORKSPACE_ROOT is pinned here because upstream's detect_workspace derives it
# from the *sourcing script's* location — which, for a delegated driver, resolves
# inside third_party/ANTfrastructure instead of the consuming repo, so
# every tool would run against the submodule tree. detect_workspace honours a
# pre-set value and still overrides to /workspace in the container, so CI is
# unaffected. This is the single most common thing to break when a wrapper is
# "simplified".
