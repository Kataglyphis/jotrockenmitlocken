# WHERE THIS COPY LIVES, because the body below cannot say it. This repo keeps
# the bootstrap at scripts/lib/, one level above the registry default
# scripts/linux/lib/, so the repo root is TWO levels up and the knob reads
# `../..`, not the `../../..` the template ships. The "scripts/linux/lib ->
# repo root is three levels" line sitting right above that knob is upstream's
# own, and it describes the DEFAULT location, not this one. It is not editable
# here: the shared-config drift gate compares this file from its first line of
# code down, byte for byte, masking only the knob's VALUE, so correcting that
# sentence in place turns the gate DRIFTED. Both deltas — the path and the knob
# value — are declared in .antfrastructure-shared.manifest; the gate that
# enforces all of it is
#   bash third_party/ANTfrastructure/shared/config/sync-shared-config.sh --repo-root . --check
# which scripts/run-lint-gates.sh runs.
