I, Jonas Heinle, take the protection of your personal data very seriously.  
In order for you to fully utilize my internet offering, it is necessary 
to collect certain information when visiting my website.  
In this privacy policy, I inform you about when I collect data about you, 
how I use this data, and what rights you have as users of the internet offering.

## II. What information do I collect and for what purpose is it used?
1. Visit to the website (server logs)
   Every visit to our website is logged in a log file to ensure data security.
   The following data is stored for a maximum of 24 hours:

   - Name of the accessed file
   - Date and time of access
   - Transferred data volume
   - Message whether the access was successful
   - IP address of the user or provider
   - Internet address of the previous page (referrer)
   - Information about the program that retrieves the data (User-Agent)

   Direct identification of you based on the IP address is not possible and is excluded.

   The IP address is only evaluated in the event of attacks on my website,
   violations of good manners, or if the internet offering is used for other illegal activities.
   In this case, identification of you based on the IP address is only possible through
   your internet provider as part of a police or prosecutorial investigation.

   This data is not used for statistical purposes.
   It is not shared with third parties for commercial or non-commercial purposes.

   Further information about the use of cookies on this website can be found in our cookie policy.

2. Entry of personal data in forms
   Within the website, there is the possibility to enter personal data for
   some (possibly upcoming) information offers.

   It is your free decision whether you enter this data. Only data necessary
   for the desired information service is requested. I treat the data confidentially
   and only use it for the purposes for which it was collected.

   If storage of your personal data is necessary for the information service used,
   your data will only be stored for as long as necessary to fulfill the offer
   or the tasks of the ministry for which the data was collected.

   If such an information offer is completed, terminated by me, or canceled by you,
   the personal data will be irrevocably deleted after a maximum of six weeks.

3. Communication via contact form or email
   If you send us a message by email, the data you provide will be used to correspond with you.

   Communication via email may have security vulnerabilities. Emails can be intercepted
   and viewed by skilled internet users on their way to me. If I receive an email from you,
   I assume that I am entitled to reply by email. Otherwise, another form of
   communication should be considered, for example, by post.

4. Links to websites of other providers and social media
   My website contains links to websites of other providers and social media.
   I expressly point out that these process the data of their users in accordance
   with their own privacy policies. I have no influence on whether these providers
   comply with data protection regulations.

## III. How do I protect children and adolescents (minor protection)?
Persons under 18 years of age should not transmit personal data to us without the
consent of their parents or legal guardians. I do not request personal data from
children and adolescents without the consent of their parents or legal guardians.
I do not knowingly collect such data and do not disclose it to third parties.

## IV. On what basis do I collect personal data?
The use of our internet offering is generally possible without providing personal
information. If I collect personal data from you on this page,
it is only done with your revocable consent (for example,
when sending newsletters according to Article 6(1)(a) of the GDPR) or to carry out
an order process (for example, for publications according to Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR).

Otherwise, I only process personal data if I am obligated to do so by law
(according to Article 6(1)(c) of the GDPR).

## V. To which recipients do I pass on data?
To provide the internet offering, I work with external service providers.
If personal data needs to be processed (for example, for sending newsletters or if you order publications),
I have taken technical and organizational measures to ensure that the data protection
regulations are also observed by external service providers.
